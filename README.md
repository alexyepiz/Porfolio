## ðŸ“ˆ Projects

### 1. [Black-Scholes vs. Real Market Pricing](./BlackScholes_vs_Market)

**Summary:**  
Statistical analysis comparing the Black-Scholes option pricing model to real market call option prices for Target Corporation.

- **Skills:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Hypothesis Testing (F-Test, T-Test), Financial Modeling
- **Key Result:** No significant difference in means or variances; Black-Scholes provides acceptable market estimates.
- **Files:**

  - [ðŸ““ Code.ipynb](./BlackScholes_vs_Market/Code.ipynb)

### 2. [Volatility Analysis of SPY Trading Volume](./SPY_Volume_ControlCharts)

**Summary:**  
Used control charts to analyze SPY trading volume and evaluate the market impact of a U.S.â€“China tariff event.

- **Skills:** Python (yfinance, pandas), Statistical Quality Control (XÌ„ and R Charts), Data Analysis with JMP
- **Key Result:** Detected assignable cause variation in trading volume linked to major financial events.
- **Files:**  
  - [ðŸ“„ Report.pdf](./SPY_Volume_ControlCharts/Report.pdf)  
  - [ðŸ““ Code.ipynb](./SPY_Volume_ControlCharts/Code.ipynb)

### 3. [FURI: Reinforcement Learning with GRU and LSTM Networks](./FURI)

**Summary:**  
Researched the effect of reinforcement learning (RL) on LSTM and GRU models for stock price prediction and algorithmic trading using SPY historical data.

- **Skills:** Time-Series Forecasting, Backtesting, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning (LSTM, GRU)  
- **Key Result:** GRU+RL showed statistically significant improvement in win rate, while LSTM+RL delivered the strongest overall performance.  
- **Files:**
